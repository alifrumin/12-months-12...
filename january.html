              <h2>Chicken Piccata and Creme Brulee with the Archambaults</h2>
              <h4>Sunday, January 4th, 2015</h4>
              <p>How to kick off a year of cooking with friends? With a food torch, Obviously. What other reason do you have to buy a food torch. Zero. Going into this purchase I was pretty sure I would only use it once. To kick off said New Years Resolution. Turns out Food Torches are dope, super easy to use. relatively safe. Still not clear what else one would use it for Esquire had some suggestions but... creme brulee seems to be enough.</p> 
              <p> With who... who better than the one and only Rachel Archambault, 21st century homemaker. This would obviously be a venture that required wine... as it should be.</p>
